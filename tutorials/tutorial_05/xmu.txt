 
XMULT
    Run multiple replications, using sectorial searches, drifting,  ratchet 
    and fusing combined.  Options are: 
      hits N             produce N hits to best length and stop 
      replications N     for each hit, search initially with N replications 
      [no]targetscore N  search until score N found (only with fusing) 
      [no]update         do not update targetscore 
      [no]giveupscore N  give up search as soon as score N found 
      [no]rss            use random sectorial searches (settings with 
                         sectsch:options) 
      [no]css            use constraint sectorial searches (settings with 
                         sectsch:options) 
      [no]xss            use exclusive sectorial searches (settings with 
                         sectsch:options) 
      [no]fuse           use fusing (settings with tfuse:options) 
      [no]gfuse N        every N hits, fuse all trees (=score check) 
      [no]dumpfuse       if fusing fails to produce trees of target score, 
                         dump the trees produced by fusing (may prevent 
                         "clogging" of subsequent fuses by keeping only the 
                         most distinct trees) 
      [no]drift N        use N cycles of drifting (settings with drif:options) 
      [no]ratchet N      use N cycles of ratchet (settings with rat:options) 
      [no]autoconst N    use consensus of previous run and initial stages of 
                         current as constraint for initial stages. 1=previous 
                         and wagner, 2=previous and SPR, 3=previous and TBR.  
                         The first replication of a new hit is never 
                         constrained (i.e. hits are totally independent). 
                         Note that level=2 defaults to 1 when "skipspr" 
                         is on. 
      [no]xmix           after unsuccesful fusing, start a new set of  
                         replications as autoconstrained (otherwise, don't) 
      [no]prvmix         if trees existed in memory before running xmult, use 
                         last one to autoconstrain first xmult replication 
      [no]consense N     consense untill consensus is stabilized N times 
      conbase N          base hits to check for consensus stabilizations 
                         (larger numbers make more reliable estimations) 
      confactor N        factor to increase number of hits to check consensus 
                         stabilization (10-100, larger numbers: more reliable) 
      conmax N           maximum new hits to recheck consensus (default=12) 
      [no]keepall        keep trees from all replications.  This has a different 
                         meaning when "hits" is 1 (=default) and when "hits" >1. 
                         When "hits" = 1, it is trees from each of the RAS + TBR + 
                         SS or DFT or RAT, in addition to the trees resulting from 
                         fusing those.  When "hits" > 1, then it means the trees 
                         resulting from fusing the initial starting trees for each 
                         of starting points.  Thus, to find N trees, each resulting 
                         from S starting points (RAS+TBR+etc) and fusing, use 
                         "xmult = hit N noupdate rep S keepall". 
      [no]retouch N      before trying new replications, repeat sectorial 
                         search and ratchet/drifting 
      level N            set level of search (0-10). Use 0-2 for easy data 
                         sets, 2-5 for medium, above 5 for difficult 
      chklevel N         check search parameters during run, every N hits. 
                         The parameters are increased or decreased, starting 
                         from user settings.  If N is preceded by +F (between 
                         0 and 2), the entire level is changed by F. If N is 
                         preceded by -, user settings are starting point 
      [no]multiply       after hitting target score, find additional trees 
                         by fusing suboptimal with optimal trees 
      [no]verbose        produce verbose reports 
    Options are set with "xmult:options;" or "xmult=options;" (using 
    ":" only settings are changed; "=" runs as well). With "xmult:;" 
    current settings are displayed.  If consensing, / followed by a taxon list 
    removes the specified taxa from the consensus (this must follow all the 
    other options).  If css, rss, and xss are specified css is done first, 
    then rss, and xss last.
