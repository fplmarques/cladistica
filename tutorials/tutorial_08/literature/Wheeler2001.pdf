Multiple sequce alignment (MSA) is a procedure to 
turn unequal length sequences into equal length character 
strings via the insertion of gaps. These gaps (“–”) 
are place holders that signify that an insertion or deletion 
has occurred somewhere, resulting in a lack of 
homologous nucleotides at that position in that taxon. 
Most alignment procedures attempt to minimize some 
cost (e.g., evolutionary length) or maximize some benefit 
(e.g., overall similarity). While the procedure to determine 
a minimum cost alignment of two sequences is 
well understood and easily accomplished (Needleman 
and Wunsch, 1970), the extension to multiple sequences 
becomes difficult rapidly. Briefly, in order to 
align two sequences, a matrix of (N � 
1) � 
(M � 
1) 
cells is created and the minimum cost path through 
this matrix given specific cost to base transformations 
and insertion–deletion events is obtained. The matrix 
is traversed in such a fashion that only the adjacent 
three cells (usually the cells above, to the left and diagonally 
up, and to the left) are examined to determine 
the cost of each cell and the most efficient path to it 
(Needleman and Wunsch, 1970). This means that for 
each of the N � 
M cells, three cells are involved in the 
calculation of every other internal cell. While this is 
manageable for two sequences (the cost of computation 
being roughly proportional to the product of the sequence 
lengths) and significant shortcuts are known, 
extension to phylogenetically interesting numbers of 
sequences is extremely time-consuming. The alignment 
matrix for “n” sequences would have “n” axes, 
and each cell would require knowledge of 2n � 
1 other 
cells. Furthermore, while the cost of spanning two sequences 
is simply the summed difference, when four 
or more sequences are involved, some tree search or 
prior knowledge is required to determine the alignment 
and its overall cost (Sankoff and Cedegren, 1983). 
These complicating factors have made true multiple 
alignment unachievable for anything but the smallest 
numbers of taxa. Real data sets require heuristic 
MSA solutions. 

The heuristic thrust for multiple alignment is quite 
simple. Since aligning two sequences is easy, build the 
multiple alignment out of a series of pairwise alignments 
guided by a binary tree. All the multiple alignment 
procedures in common use today follow this idea,

but differ in how they obtain the binary “guide” tree 
and how they add the pairwise results together to 
generate the complete alignment. Three implementations 
of heuristic alignment algorithms that are in some 
use today are CLUSTAL (Higgins and Sharp, 1988; 
Higgins et al., 1992, 1996; Higgins, 1994; Jeanmougin 
et al., 1998; Thompson et al., 1994, 1997), TREEALIGN 
(Hein, 1989, 1990), and MALIGN (Wheeler and 
Gladstein, 1994, 1991–1998). Each of these methods 
relies on guide trees to accrete pairwise alignment. In 
the cases of CLUSTAL and TREEALIGN, a distance 
tree is calculated from the pairwise alignment costs 
and this distance tree becomes the guide tree. In the 
case of CLUSTAL, this is a Fitch–Margoliash tree; 
TREEALIGN uses a method developed by Hein (1989, 
1990). At the nodes (vertices) of the guide trees, consensus 
(CLUSTAL) or quasi-optimized (TREEALIGN) single 
sequences are created from the aligned pair, which 
is then submitted to another pairwise alignment further 
down the tree. When the root of the guide tree is 
reached, the various gaps inserted on the way down 
are placed into the sequences at the tips, creating sequences 
of equal length—the multiple alignment. 

MALIGN also uses guide trees, but differs from 
CLUSTAL and TREEALIGN in that it examines multiple 
guide trees. These guide trees are generated 
through standard tree search procedures of tree building 
and branch swapping. Furthermore, no individual 
sequences are created at the internal vertices, but the 
sequences descending from that node are carried along 
and aligned in a modified pairwise manner. During 
the search procedure, a complete multiple alignment is 
generated for each candidate guide tree, and a heuristic 
phylogenetic search is performed on the multiple alignment. 
That alignment (or alignments if multiple solutions 
are found) that produces the most parsimonious 
(i.e., lowest cost) phylogenetic result is chosen as the 
“best” multiple alignment. As a result of this search 
procedure, MALIGN will frequently examine many 
thousands or millions of candidate alignments (usually 
about n3 for n sequences). Not surprisingly, CLUSTAL 
and TREEALIGN frequently generate results more rapidly 
than MALIGN. 

Each of these methods, as an implementation of multiple 
alignment, yields the same type of result—a series 
of column vectors that are then submitted to phylogenetic 
analysis. When phylogenetic analysis takes place, 
the putative homologies are not altered or reexamined

PROBLEMS WITH MULTIPLE ALIGNMENT 

Since multiple alignment creates putative homology 
schemes without reference to the diagnosis of any specific 
phylogenetic topology, it may be that some alignments 
are more favorably disposed to certain topologies 
than others. Consider four sequences, “GGGG,” 
“GAAG,” “GGG,” and “GAA,” and a cost regime of 
2 for indels and 1 for base substitutions of all flavors. 
If we were to use the alignment 

I GGGG 
II -GGG 
III G A A G 
IV -G A A 

the topology ((I III)(II IV) is optimal, with a length of 
six steps. The topology linking I and II [(I II) (III IV)] 
would require seven steps and [(II III)(I IV)] eight steps. 
However, suppose we had based our analysis on the 
following alignment: 

I GGGG 
II G-GG 
III GAAG 
IV GAA-. 

In this case, topology [(I II)(III IV)] is optimal at six 
steps and the other two topologies would require seven 
steps. Furthermore, a third alignment, 

I GGGG 

II GGG


III GAAG 

IV GAA-, 
would require six steps for both [(I II)(III IV)] and 
[(I III)(II IV)] with eight steps for [(I IV)(II III)]. 

Each of these three alignments appears reasonable 
and can achieve a most parsimonious solution. If we 
had used either alignments 1 or 2, however, we would 
not have missed a solution. These alignments would 
have been specified before the analysis, and no provision 
could have been made to allow individual topologies 
to be diagnosed with their best-case alignment. In

short, cladograms were determining final homology 
(i.e., synapomorphy), but had no role whatsoever in 
putative homology. 

OPTIMIZATION ALIGNMENT 

A response to the lack of interaction between topology 
and putative homology is optimization alignment 
(OA; Wheeler, 1996). This method of directly optimizing 
sequence variation creates a unique set of putative 
homologies (base correspondences) for each topology. 
Not only are nucleotide changes and insertion– 
deletion events minimized, but the base correspondences 
themselves are chosen to minimize tree length. 
The goal of the process is to yield parsimonious cladograms 
in terms of the weighted sum of nucleotide 
transformations and insertion–deletion events. Like 
alignment, homologies are created at the level of nucleotide 
position or base to base. Unlike alignment, however, 
these homologies are dynamically determined 
and uniquely tailored to each topology. 

The procedure is based on the heuristic determination 
of hypothetical ancestral sequences. The algorithm 
begins with an internal node (or vertex) with two terminal 
observed sequences as descendants (Fig. 1). The 
most parsimonious hypothetical ancestral sequence is

given topology.

cedure 
whereby all ancestral sequences are implicitly 
examined. This is accomplished in a manner very close 
to a pairwise alignment, except that the cost to be 
minimized is the weighted union/intersection cost 
usually used to diagnose phylogenetic hypotheses and 
“gaps” are optimized out since real sequences do not 
contain unambiguous gaps. This is explained in more 
detail elsewhere (Fig. 2; Wheeler, 1996, 2000, 2001). A 
second difference is that the product of this operation 
is a single sequence and the cost of producing that 
sequence from its descendants. This sequence is then 
used as one of the descendants of its parent node, and 
the operation is repeated. The weighted sum of all the 
events required to form the nodal sequences is the cost 
of the cladogram as with other Sankoff-style character 
optimizations. After this “down-pass,” an “up-pass” 
can be performed to determine the most parsimonious 
set of character states at each position for each hypothetical 
ancestor. 

In the case of the three sequences mentioned above, 
OA yields both of the length-6 cladograms directly and 
the alternate patterns of homology are presented as 
alternate synapomorphy schemes. 

FIXED-STATE OPTIMIZATION 

Even with the dynamic homology schemes created 
via OA, considerable confusion may remain with 
“gappy” sequences of greatly unequal length. Situations 
frequently occur in which the members of one 


Ward Wheeler 

group (or individual sequence) have hundreds of nucleotides 
while others seem to have none or just a few. 
In these situations, huge numbers of insertion–deletion 
events need to be postulated (they must go somewhere) 
and the placement of these gaps can seem haphazard. 
Furthermore, these indels must be accounted 
for over several ancestral nodes of the cladogram (OA) 
or in all taxa (multiple alignment), causing considerable 
damage downstream. 

The motivating force behind this behavior is the 
treatment of the individual nucleotides as potential 
homologies. If the entire fragment were to be treated 
as a unified structure, as with a large complex morphological 
feature, the extreme apomorphy of such a sequence 
would not spill over into other areas of comparison. 
This is the idea behind fixed-state character 
optimization (FSO; Wheeler, 1999b). FSO treats contiguous 
strings of nucleotides as character states in a complex 
character defined by the extent of homologous 
regions of nucleotide sequence. In this way, the entire 
18S rDNA might be a character, with the actual sequences 
exhibited by individual taxa as the character 
states. Each unique sequence defines a character state. 
Potentially, there are as many character states as taxa. 
This would seem to be uninformative, and it would 
be if all the transformations among all the states were 
taken to be equally costly. This is not the case, however. 
The transformation costs among the states are determined 
by the weighted sum of the various events required 
to transform one sequence into another, i.e., the 
minimum edit cost in indels, transitions, and transversion 
(or any other specified transformation types). 
These edit costs define a matrix of pair-wise transformation 
costs among the states (Fig. 3). The optimization 
step then proceeds via a standard dynamic optimization 
(Sankoff-style) procedure for a multistate character 
with predetermined transformation costs (Sankoff 
and Rousseau, 1975). 

Since the states of the character are defined by the

thetical 
ancestral states (5sequences) is limited. Arbitrary 
combinations of nucleotides are not permitted; 
hence the cladogram length will in most cases be 
longer. This phenomenon will become less pronounced 
with increases in the numbers of taxa, which can increase 
the number of possible nodal states. Furthermore, 
“impossible” secondary structure, stop codons, 
etc. cannot occur, since only observed sequences are 
reconstructed at the internal nodes. 

CONGRUENCE AND COMPARISON 

Although each of these three methods of optimizing 
sequence characters is based on parsimony, the entities 
that are minimized differ. MSA seeks to minimize

global, static nucleotide changes; while optimization 
seeks to do this also, it allows for topology-specific 
putative homology schemes. These two methods, however, 
are minimizing the same combinations of base 
changes and indels, but in different ways. FSO seeks 
to minimize the overall change (in nucleotide substitutions 
and indels) as well, but in the form of transformations 
among a limited set of extremely complex character 
states. If the actual lengths of cladograms presented 
by these methods are not directly comparable, how can 
meaningful choices be made among these techniques? 

Congruence among data is the fulcrum of parsimonious 
phylogenetic analysis. The cladogram indicating 
the greatest congruence among characters (most parsimonious) 
is the least contradicted and the most favored. 
This logic can be extended to among-data set 
comparisons. Methods that result in greater congruence 
among data sets are more desirable than others. 
This congruence may be measured in two ways: character 
based and topology based. Character congruence 
seeks to assay the level of homoplasy incurred through 
the combination of data, usually measured by the ILD 
(Mickevich and Farris, 1981) and expressed as a percentage 
of combined cladogram length due to among-
data set homoplasy. Topological measures of congruence 
attempt to describe the degree of agreement 
among the results of phylogenetic analyses. The similarity 
of cladograms generated from several data sets

1999a). 

Here we will apply both character and topological 
congruence measures to analysis of arthropod 
(Wheeler et al., 1993; Wheeler, 1999a,b) and chelicerate 
(Wheeler and Hayashi, 1998) data sets to examine the 
relative performance of MSA, OA, and MSO analyses. 

Each of the two test data sets (arthropod and chelicerate) 
consists of morphological and multiple molecular 
data sets. The character incongruence (as measured 
by ILD) and taxonomic incongruence (as measured by 
TILD) will be used to distinguish among these three approaches. 


Arthropods 

The arthropod data set is an enlarged version of 
the data set of Wheeler et al. (1993) used in Wheeler 
(1999a,b). This data set consists of 26 taxa, one of which, 
Trilobita, is extinct and “missing” for all molecular 
data. For the extant taxa, three sources of molecular 
information are used: 18S rDNA (an approximately 
1000-bp fragment), 28S rDNA (an approximately 350bp 
fragment), and Ubiquitin (228 bp). A morphological 
data set of 100 discrete characters for all of the taxa 
was also analyzed (Table 1 and Fig. 4). 

Chelicerates 

The chelicerate data set is that of Wheeler and Hayashi 
(1998). This data set consists of 34 taxa (one with 
morphology only), 93 morphological characters, 18S 
rDNA, and 28SrDNA fragments (Table 2 and Fig. 5). 

MSA, OA, and FSO were each performed on these 
data sets. In the case of the arthropods, morphological 
character transformations and indels were assigned a 
cost of 2 and transversions and transitions 1. For the 
chelicerate case, all transformations (morphological, 
indels, transversions, and transitions) were assigned 
equal weight (1). Multiple alignment was performed 
using the program MALIGN (Wheeler and Gladstein, 
1991–1998, 1994). This is not necessarily the best or 
certainly the only way to perform multiple alignment, 
but MALIGN attempts to create parsimonious alignments, 
those that generate parsimonious cladograms, 
and hence most appropriate to parsimony-based phylogenetic 
reconstruction. OA and FSO were accomplished 
through the use of POY (Gladstein and 
Wheeler, 1997).

In both cases, character congruence and topological 
congruence are maximized by FSO and minimized by 
MSA. The results of these analyses are summarized in 
Tables 3 and 4. 

DISCUSSION 


The central question raised by these modes of analysis 
is what are the units to be homologized? Since OA 
and MSA purport to optimize numerically identical 




directly comparable (as stated above). In the comparisons 
here, both character and topological congruence 
measures were higher for FSO. If congruence were the 
undisputed determinate of methodological superiority, 
the case would rely on the accumulation of such examples 
until a clear pattern presented itself. If the conclusions 
of the two data sets examined here held generally, 
FSO would be the way to go and sequence level homology 
would be preferred over nucleotide-level comparisons. 
This is not necessarily the case, however (see 
Edgecombe et al., 1999 for a counter example). 

The choice of comparable or homologous entities is 
also one of epistemology. How do we perceive variation, 
information, and transformation among variable 
sequences? The choice can be (and perhaps should be) 
made on grounds completely unrelated to the behavior 
of any data. The choice can be made on an ontological 
or even an aesthetic basis. On the other hand, an operational 
or optimality-based perspective is also possible.
